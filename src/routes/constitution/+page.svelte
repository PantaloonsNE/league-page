  <li>Example: It is not permitted to acquire a player to cover bye weeks or injuries with a prearranged plan to return that player in a few weeks.</li>
  <li>Every trade must stand on its own merit and be enforceable as final at the time of execution.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Managers may not offer or accept real money, services, or goods in exchange for fantasy football outcomes (e.g., wins, trades, players, picks).</li>

  <li>Penalties may include reversal of trades, loss of draft picks, forfeiture of games, or removal from the league depending on severity.</li>
